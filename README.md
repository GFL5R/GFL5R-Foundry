Dive into the gritty, near-future world of *Girls' Frontline* with **GFL5R Foundry**, a tabletop RPG system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop. This is **L5R's Mechanics, GFL's Universe**: the acclaimed dice system and core rules of *Legend of the Five Rings* (L5R) reimagined in the dystopian sci-fi setting of GFL. Command Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) and human operatives in turn-based tactical combat, navigate moral dilemmas in a radiation-scarred world, and forge alliances in a universe on the brink of collapse. Set in 2070, six years after the events of *Girls' Frontline* and four years before *Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium*, experience the samurai-inspired elegance of L5R in a high-tech, post-apocalyptic Europe.

## What is GFL5R?

GFL5R is *Legend of the Five Rings* (L5R) mechanics transplanted into the *Girls' Frontline* universe. L5R's iconic ring-and-skill dice system, approach-based character creation, and strife/fortune balance shine in a near-future setting ravaged by the Collapse, a mysterious radiation that turns machines rogue and humans into mutants. Private military companies like Griffin & Kryuger deploy android soldiers called Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) to maintain order, but as rogue AIs rebel and old alliances crumble, players must navigate intrigue, combat, and survival.

This Foundry VTT system brings L5R's tactical depth and narrative focus to GFL's rich setting, with deep character customization and immersive storytelling. Whether you're an L5R veteran seeking a sci-fi twist or a GFL fan exploring tabletop RPGs, GFL5R offers endless possibilities for campaigns filled with betrayal, heroism, and high-tech warfare.

## Key Features

### Iconic L5R Dice System
- **Black Dice (Ring Dice)**: Straight from L5R: represent your character's innate approaches (e.g., Power, Swiftness). Faces include successes, opportunities, strife, and explosive results for dynamic, unpredictable outcomes.
- **White Dice (Skill Dice)**: Also from L5R: tied to trained skills, offering more consistent results with bonuses for expertise.
- **Interactive Rolling**: Use the built-in roller app for keep/reroll/explode mechanics, just like L5R. Watch your dice pool evolve in real-time during sessions. Perfect for tense combat or social encounters.
- **Fortune and Strife**: L5R's balance of luck and tension with fortune points that can turn the tide, and strife that builds toward character collapse.

### Character Creation & Customization (L5R-Inspired)
- **Dual Character Types**:
  - **Humans**: Choose from nationalities (e.g., Rossartrist, Sangvis) and backgrounds for rich roleplaying. Start with approaches, skills, and resources like fatigue, strife, and fortune points, adapted from L5R's clans and families.
  - **T-Dolls**: Android operatives based on real-world firearms. Select frames (e.g., IOP SST-05, Sangvis DSI-8) and customize with modules, disciplines, and abilities. Watch as your Doll evolves from a nameless unit to a self-aware ally, echoing L5R's honor and enlightenment themes.
- **Disciplines**: A proud divergence from L5R: master up to 5 disciplines (e.g., Combat, Hacking, Survival) instead of a single school. Build your ideal life path with XP progression, unlocking abilities that define your character's journey in this fractured world.
- **Derived Stats**: Automatically calculate endurance, composure, vigilance, focus, and more based on your approaches and resources, mirroring L5R's derived attributes.

### Immersive Setting & Storytelling
- **2070 (Post-GFL1 Era)**: Set in the aftermath of the original *Girls' Frontline*, where Griffin & Kryuger dissolves, T-Dolls adopt personal names, and new threats emerge, paralleling L5R's themes of change and destiny.
- **Moral Complexity**: Deal with themes of AI sentience, corporate greed, and human-android relations, akin to L5R's bushido and clan conflicts. Will your T-Doll choose loyalty or freedom?
- **Modular Campaigns**: From bounty hunting missions to large-scale PMC wars, the system supports solo adventures or epic sagas, with L5R's narrative depth.

### Foundry Integration
- **Drag-and-Drop Sheets**: Intuitive actor and item sheets for quick setup. Drop disciplines, weapons, and modules directly onto characters.
- **Hooks & Automation**: Items seamlessly apply upgrades to your character, increasing stats and skills, calculating damage, the whole 9 yards!
