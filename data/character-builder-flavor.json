      "lead1": "In the year 2070, most surviving Green Zones are nominally under the umbrella of the URNC, a multinational council born to stabilize what remained of human civilization. But most people still hold onto the idea of nationality. Where you were born and raised shapes how others see you, and how you see the w    ld.",
      "lead2": "Every Commander begins with all Approaches at 1. Your nationality grants +1 to two A  ppr  oaches."
    },
    "step2": {
      "lead1": "Your nationality defines where you were born, but your background defines what you did before you became a bounty hunter. Were you raised in the rigid halls of a military academy, the fluorescent sprawl of a corporate office, or the scavenger's life among ruins and forgotten battlefields?\n\nMechanically, your background grants +1 to one Approach and one starting Skill.\n\nThe following are sample backgrounds, feel free to   come up with your own!"
    },
    "step3": {
      "lead1": "Sooner or later, you had to make a choice: what kind of Commander are you? Some Commanders fight shoulder-to-shoulder with their Dolls, while others coordinate from the rear, negotiate with allies, or outthink their rivals.",
      "lead2": "Select one Discipline. It is now unlocked for you, and you gain its starting perk and one rank in all its associated skills. Over time, you'll advance further into this Discipline, or branch out into others."

    "advantage": "Maybe you have a talent for keeping calm when everything goes wrong. Maybe you're unusually lucky, or skilled at reading people. Or maybe you've simply refused to quit when others broke under pressure.\n\nSelect one Advantage from the list of advantages. This represents the quality that elevates you above the rest, the edge that's carried you this far, and might carry you farther still.",
    "disadvantage": "You've survived this long, but survival doesn't mean perfection. Maybe you carry a bad habit, a scar from your past, or a weakness you can't shake. It could be pride, doubt, greed, or the fallout of a mistake that's never stopped haunting you.\n\nEveryone in this line of work has a flaw. Yours might only surface under pressure, but when it does, it costs you.\n\nSelect one Disadvantage from the list of disadvantages. This represents the faultline in your character, the thing that threatens to crack when the pressure mounts.",
    "passion": "Maybe you have a ritual before every mission, a superstition you refuse to let go, or a hobby that makes no sense to anyone else. Some people gamble, some keep diaries, some polish their boots every night even when there's no point.\n\nIt doesn't have to make sense. It just has to be yours.\n\nSelect one Passion from the list of passions. This is the habit, interest, or fixation that marks you as yourself. It may grant you a minor benefit in play, but more importantly, it's the detail that makes your Commander more than just another gun for hire.",
    "anxiety": "Even hardened veterans carry fear. Maybe it's the thought of failing your squad. Maybe it's losing control, or being powerless when people depend on you. It could be as simple as dying forgotten in some wasteland ditch, or as complicated as becoming the very kind of tyrant you once fought against.\n\nFear drives choices. Sometimes it sharpens you, other times it paralyzes you. Either way, it's always there.\n\nSelect one Anxiety from the list of anxieties. This is the shadow that follows you, the risk or outcome you dread most, even if you never say it out loud.",
    "viewDolls": "Every Commander works with Dolls, but not every Commander sees them the same way. To some, they are soldiers, valuable, but replaceable. To others, they are partners, comrades, even family.\n\nYour answer to this question defines more than your attitude, it shapes how your Doll experiences their bond with you. Respect, suspicion, affection, or distance: whichever you choose will color every interaction you have in the field.\n\nDecide how your Commander views Dolls. You don't need to lock it in forever, but start with where you are now. Are Dolls tools? Allies? Students? Friends? Experiments? Something else entirely?",
    "goal": "Bounty hunters don't risk their lives in the ruins for nothing. Some chase money, fame, or power. Others fight for ideals: to protect people, to rebuild the world, or to carve out a place where their name will be remembered. A few are simply running from something they'd rather not face.\n\nWhatever it is, this goal drives you forward. It's why you take contracts, why you shoulder the responsibility of leading Dolls into danger, and why you keep going when it would be easier to stop.\n\nChoose a personal goal. This is what your Commander wants to achieve in their lifetime, even at the cost of everyone around you.",
    "nameMeaning": "A name is never just a label. Maybe it carries family history, meant to honor someone who came before. Maybe it's a call sign you earned in the field. Maybe it's a name you chose for yourself when the old life didn't fit anymore.\n\nNames shape expectations. They carry weight in introductions, in contracts, and in whispers behind your back.\n\nDecide what your name means. Was it inherited, gifted, earned, or taken? What story do people hear when they say it?",
    "storyEnd": "Everyone dies. Some quietly, some suddenly, some in ways that change the world around them. Maybe you expect to go out in battle, side by side with your Doll. Maybe you imagine living long enough to see the world rebuilt. Or maybe you don't expect to live long at all.\n\nWhatever you believe, every Commander wonders how their story will end.\n\nThis question has no bearing on mechanics, but keep your answer in mind. Your GM certainly will..."

  "tdoll": {
    "intro": "Creating a T-Doll is a little different than creating your Commander. Humans are shaped by their pasts: choices, training, and circumstance. Dolls, on the other hand, are built. Every model starts with a frame, the physical chassis that defines its baseline strengths and limitations. From there, your Doll can be fitted with specialized upgrades, modules, and quirks that make them more than just another unit rolling off the production line.\n\nBut make no mistake: Dolls are more than the sum of their parts. They may have been assembled in a factory, but they grow, change, and express themselves in ways no design document could predict. When you build a Doll, bear in mind that you're not just designing a weapon, you're designing a person.",
    "step1": {
      "lead1": "Every Doll begins with a Frame: the factory that produced you and the model designation stamped into your chassis. Your Frame sets your baseline Approaches, gives you two starting Skills, and anchors a bit of roleplaying flavor: how you move, how you respond to damage, and how people react when they see you.",
      "lead2": "Pick the manufacturer and model that fits the concept you want to play, then note its Approaches and Skills on your sheet."
    },
    "step2": {
      "lead1": "From the moment of activation, most T-Dolls carry a weapon imprint. For some Dolls, this imprint feels like destiny: the rifle that steadied their aim the first time they pulled the trigger, or the blade that taught them balance and discipline. For others, it's a shackle: an expectation they've struggled to outgrow or redefine.",
      "lead2": "Select a weapon discipline from the list. You begin play with the first rank of that discipline completed. This represents the weapon type that was imprinted into your systems at the start of your service."
    },
    "step3": {
      "lead1": "Every SSD-62, every CRAR, every DSI-8 rolled off the line with the same baseline specifications. But you aren't just another number in a production log. Somewhere along the way, someone invested in you, fitting you with custom modules, running extra training cycles, or upgrading your systems.",
      "lead2": "Every Doll begins with 10 Upgrade Points. You may spend them to: Increase an Approach (+1 for 2 points, max 4 at creation), Train a Skill (1 point each), or Install an Upgrade Module (cost varies)."
    },
    "advantage": "Every Doll is designed to perform tasks. But at some point, you went beyond simply performing: you excelled. Perhaps you carried a mission to completion under impossible odds, protected someone who mattered to you, or solved a problem in a way nobody expected.\n\nThis moment stands out in your memory as proof that you can rise above expectations. Select one Advantage from the list of advantages. This represents the edge you carry into every mission, born of that defining achievement.",
    "disadvantage": "No Doll is flawless. Some carry limitations hardwired into their frames; others bear damage or errors that linger in their systems. You might have a weakness in combat, a mental blind spot, or an emotional burden that makes life harder for you.\n\nThis is the flaw you wrestle with: the thing that slows you down or causes trouble at the worst moments. It might frustrate you, but it also gives shape to the struggles you'll face. Select one Disadvantage from the list of disadvantages. This represents the weight you carry, and the obstacle you'll have to overcome.",
    "passion": "Every Doll picks up quirks: odd little habits, fascinations, or interests that weren't part of the blueprint. Maybe you collect things. Maybe you sing when you're nervous. Maybe you imitate human behaviors that don't make sense to you, or cling to a routine no one else understands.\n\nThese quirks can be charming, unsettling, or downright baffling, but they make you stand out, and they're part of your identity. Select one Passion from the list of passions. A Passion is something your Doll clings to, loves, or refuses to give up. It may give you a minor benefit in play, but more importantly it colors how you interact with the world.",
    "anxiety": "Even the strongest frame can hesitate. Deep in your neural cloud, there's something that gnaws at you: a thought you can't banish, a risk you dread, or a future you don't want to face.\n\nThis fear doesn't need to make sense to others. It might even seem irrational. But it is real to you. Sometimes it keeps you cautious; other times, it threatens to overwhelm you. Select one Anxiety from the list of anxieties. This represents the shadow hanging over your actions: the thing you hope never comes to pass, but might someday confront you.",
    "metCommander": "Every Doll's story eventually intersects with a Commander's. For some, it begins the moment they're activated, stepping off the assembly line to salute the human they were made to serve. For others, it's more complicated: reassigned after a failed mission, transferred from one owner to the next, or even pulled from a scrapyard and given a second chance.\n\nThink about how that first meeting went. Was it professional and clinical? Warm and hopeful? Or awkward, strained, and uncertain? Did you choose your Commander, or were you chosen by them?",
    "goal": "No matter how kind a Commander, how close the bond, they are still not you. Your missions may give you purpose, but you carry a purpose of your own as well.\n\nMaybe it's something small and human: a place you long to see, a skill you want to learn, or a keepsake you wish to hold. Maybe it's something larger, even dangerous: freedom from orders, revenge against someone who wronged you, or the chance to decide your own future.\n\nChoose a personal goal. This is the horizon your Doll is always walking toward, whether in secret or in plain sight.",
    "nameOrigin": "Every Doll receives a designation, but names are rarely so simple. Some are assigned an alphanumeric code by the factory, others are renamed by their Commander, and a few take names for themselves. A name carries weight. It shapes how humans see you, how other Dolls relate to you, and how you think about yourself.",
    "storyEnd": "Every Doll wonders, in quiet moments, how long they have left. Some imagine being retired to safe duty, guarding a home or tending to records. Others see themselves scrapped on a workbench, stripped for parts. Many expect to die in battle, protecting a Commander, a squadmate, or a mission that mattered more than they did.\n\nHow do you believe your story will end? Is it quiet? Is it violent? Is it something else entirely?\n\nThis question has no bearing on mechanics, but you should keep your answer in mind. Your GM certainly will…"
