"step1": {
  "lead1": "In the year 2070, most surviving Green Zones are nominally under the umbrella of the URNC, a multinational council born to stabilize what remained of human civilization. But most people still hold onto the idea of nationality. Where you were born and raised shapes how others see you, and how you see the world.",
  "lead2": "Every Commander begins with all Approaches at 1. Your nationality grants +1 to two Approaches."
},
"step2": {
  "lead1": "Your nationality defines where you were born, but your background defines what you did before you became a bounty hunter. Were you raised in the rigid halls of a military academy, the fluorescent sprawl of a corporate office, or the scavenger's life among ruins and forgotten battlefields?\n\nMechanically, your background grants +1 to one Approach and one starting Skill.\n\nThe following are sample backgrounds, feel free to come up with your own!"
},
    "step3": {
      "lead1": "Sooner or later, you had to make a choice: what kind of Commander are you? Some Commanders fight shoulder-to-shoulder with their Dolls, while others coordinate from the rear, negotiate with allies, or outthink their rivals.",
      "lead2": "Select one Discipline. It is now unlocked for you, and you gain its starting perk and one rank in all its associated skills. Over time, you'll advance further into this Discipline, or branch out into others."
    },
    "advantage": "Maybe you have a talent for keeping calm when everything goes wrong. Maybe you're unusually lucky, or skilled at reading people. Or maybe you've simply refused to quit when others broke under pressure.\n\nSelect one Advantage from the list of advantages. This represents the quality that elevates you above the rest, the edge that's carried you this far, and might carry you farther still.",
    "disadvantage": "You've survived this long, but survival doesn't mean perfection. Maybe you carry a bad habit, a scar from your past, or a weakness you can't shake. It could be pride, doubt, greed, or the fallout of a mistake that's never stopped haunting you.\n\nEveryone in this line of work has a flaw. Yours might only surface under pressure, but when it does, it costs you.\n\nSelect one Disadvantage from the list of disadvantages. This represents the faultline in your character, the thing that threatens to crack when the pressure mounts.",
    "passion": "Maybe you have a ritual before every mission, a superstition you refuse to let go, or a hobby that makes no sense to anyone else. Some people gamble, some keep diaries, some polish their boots every night even when there's no point.\n\nIt doesn't have to make sense. It just has to be yours.\n\nSelect one Passion from the list of passions. This is the habit, interest, or fixation that marks you as yourself. It may grant you a minor benefit in play, but more importantly, it's the detail that makes your Commander more than just another gun for hire.",
    "anxiety": "Even hardened veterans carry fear. Maybe it's the thought of failing your squad. Maybe it's losing control, or being powerless when people depend on you. It could be as simple as dying forgotten in some wasteland ditch, or as complicated as becoming the very kind of tyrant you once fought against.\n\nFear drives choices. Sometimes it sharpens you, other times it paralyzes you. Either way, it's always there.\n\nSelect one Anxiety from the list of anxieties. This is the shadow that follows you, the risk or outcome you dread most, even if you never say it out loud.",
    "viewDolls": "Every Commander works with Dolls, but not every Commander sees them the same way. To some, they are soldiers, valuable, but replaceable. To others, they are partners, comrades, even family.\n\nYour answer to this question defines more than your attitude, it shapes how your Doll experiences their bond with you. Respect, suspicion, affection, or distance: whichever you choose will color every interaction you have in the field.\n\nDecide how your Commander views Dolls. You don't need to lock it in forever, but start with where you are now. Are Dolls tools? Allies? Students? Friends? Experiments? Something else entirely?",
    "goal": "Bounty hunters don't risk their lives in the ruins for nothing. Some chase money, fame, or power. Others fight for ideals: to protect people, to rebuild the world, or to carve out a place where their name will be remembered. A few are simply running from something they'd rather not face.\n\nWhatever it is, this goal drives you forward. It's why you take contracts, why you shoulder the responsibility of leading Dolls into danger, and why you keep going when it would be easier to stop.\n\nChoose a personal goal. This is what your Commander wants to achieve in their lifetime, even at the cost of everyone around you.",
    "nameMeaning": "A name is never just a label. Maybe it carries family history, meant to honor someone who came before. Maybe it's a call sign you earned in the field. Maybe it's a name you chose for yourself when the old life didn't fit anymore.\n\nNames shape expectations. They carry weight in introductions, in contracts, and in whispers behind your back.\n\nDecide what your name means. Was it inherited, gifted, earned, or taken? What story do people hear when they say it?",
    "storyEnd": "Everyone dies. Some quietly, some suddenly, some in ways that change the world around them. Maybe you expect to go out in battle, side by side with your Doll. Maybe you imagine living long enough to see the world rebuilt. Or maybe you don't expect to live long at all.\n\nWhatever you believe, every Commander wonders how their story will end.\n\nThis question has no bearing on mechanics, but keep your answer in mind. Your GM certainly will..."
